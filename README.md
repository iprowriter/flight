# Getting Started with this Flight React App

This is a new project that is still under construction. I'm currently building a flight booking website.

# Run PROJECT
To run this project, simply clone the repo and then do `npm install` on the root folder.

The project will start on localhost:3000

# Techstack Used so Far
1. Figma (for designing the UI)
2. React
3. TypeScript
4. REST API
5. Redux (for managing state)
6. Material-UI

NodeJs and Express backend are yet to be implemented
GraphQl will also be implemented instead of REST API

Thank you and check back later for a finished project
